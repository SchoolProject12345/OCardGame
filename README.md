# Omy's Card Game

OCardGame is a simple but chaotic card game coded exhaustively in Python. Inspired by the popular game _Magic The Gathering_, the game revolves around fighting with powerful fantasy creatures through unique abilities!

## Basic Rules

- Each player has a deck of 15 cards, draws 5 to hand on game start.
- Place cards on the arena to use them, this costs energy.
- Use free default attacks or energy-costing abilities to attack, once per card per turn.
- You gain energy on each turn end, depending on the energy/turn and maximum energy values, which can be altered by cards, passives and abilities.
- You also draw until you have 5 cards in hand on each turn end.
- Deal damage to charge your commander's ultimate attack.
- Defeat the enemy commander to win the game.
- You can modify your game experience extensively using `options.txt`.
